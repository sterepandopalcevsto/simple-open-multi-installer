It's simple multi-installer

## how to add new programs?
1. open "installer_config.txt"
2. make a new line anywhere and add on this form <programm name>;<url to download installer>;{installer} -ms
3. do not touch -> {installer} or anything can happen (I stopped webview working everywhere).

### Have a great new year 2024!!!
